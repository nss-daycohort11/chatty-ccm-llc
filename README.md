# Chatty team exercise

This group project is more about [pair programming](http://www.wikihow.com/Pair-Program) than division of labor. You will all be working on a similar problem and taking turns helping solve it.

You will be creating your first, very simple, single page application (SPA). It will be a very basic implementation of Slack.

## Adding listeners to dynamically created elements

When you add a DOM element to your page with JavaScript, you cannot add a listener to them directly in your code with `addEventListener`. This is because the element didn't exist when your JavaScript file got parsed and executed by the browser when it loaded. What you need to do is listen for the event on the `<body>` element, and then inspect what the target of the event is (i.e. which element the user actually performed the action on).

```js
document.querySelector("body").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  console.log(event);

  // Handle the click event on any li
  if (event.target.tagName.toLowerCase() === "li") {
    console.log("You clicked on an <li> element");
  }

  // Handle the click event on any DOM element with a certain class
  if (event.target.className === "article-section") {
    console.log("You clicked on an `article-section` element");
  }

  // Inspect the `id` property of the event target
  if (event.target.id === "page-title") {
    console.log("You clicked on the page-title element");
  }
});
```

## Setting element attributes

You can use JavaScript to [set any attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute) on a DOM element. You've seen how to add/remove classes with `classList.add()`, `classList.remove()`, and `classList.toggle()`, but you can also add `id`, `href`, `src`, or any other attribute.

Here's an example of how to add a `disabled` attribute to a button in the DOM.

```html
<button class="clear-messages">Clear messages</button>
```

```js
// This will disable the first button with a class of "button-message"
document.getElementsByClassName("button-message")[0].setAttribute("disabled", true);
```

## Requirements

Check out the [simple wireframe](https://app.moqups.com/chortlehoort/uGBbLbK46Y/view/page/a9d5cd7bf) for this application on Moqups.com.

### Navigation bar

COMPLETED 1. Create an element to serve as the navigation bar for your application.
COMPLETED 1. Create an element to hold the logo for your application. It can be as simple as text, but if you want to find an image, that's fine.
COMPELTED 1. Create a input field for a user to enter in a message.
COMPLETED 1. Add an event listener for "keypress" and detect when then return key has been pressed in the message field.
COMPLETED 1. When return key is detected, you'll create a new message (*see details below*).
COMPLETED 1. Create a button to clear all messages.
COMPLETED 1. When the user clicks the clear messages button, all current chat messages should be removed from the application.
1. If there are no messages, then the clear messages button should be disabled (*see example above*).
1. The navigation bar should remain at the top of the screen, even if the contents of the page start to scroll.

### Options

1. Create two checkboxes below the message input field. One labeled "Dark theme" and the other labeled "Large text".
1. When the user clicks on the dark theme checkbox, change the background color of your application to a dark gray, and the font color for messages should be white(ish)... you pick.
1. If the user unchecks the box, the background color should change back to white with black text for messages.

### Messages
1. When the user presses the return key in the message field, create a `<div>` element in the DOM, below the input field that will hold all messages as they get created.
1. The message should have a button displayed after it with the text "Delete" inside of it.
1. When the delete button next to a message is clicked, only that message should be removed from the DOM.
